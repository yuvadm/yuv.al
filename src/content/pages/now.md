## Homepage Refresh

Pushing a new update to this homepage based on Astro.js. Moving from the previous DIY Pythonic setup to a more modern stack. The new architecture provides better performance, cleaner code organization, and improved developer experience.

## Namekit

Working on [Namekit](https://namekit.app) as my main product - an AI-based domain name search engine, with availability checking and brand name generation. It's designed to help entrepreneurs, marketers, and developers find the perfect domain names for their projects.

## Agentic Coding Experiments

Diving deep into experimentations with agentic coding and AI-assisted development. Exploring how AI agents can augment the development workflow, from code generation to testing and deployment. Currently testing various approaches to human-AI collaboration in software engineering.

## Life with Two Small Kids

Navigating the beautiful chaos of life with two small children. Learning to balance focused development work with family time, optimizing for both code quality and dad duties. Finding that parenting has surprisingly improved my project management skills and ability to work efficiently in short bursts.
