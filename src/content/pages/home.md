Exploring the intersection of technology and creativity since the early days of the web. With a background in distributed systems and a passion for elegant design, I craft digital experiences that push boundaries while maintaining simplicity and functionality.

My work spans from low-level system architecture to high-level user interfaces, always with a focus on performance, security, and user experience. Currently fascinated by the potential of AI systems to augment human creativity and the role of decentralized networks in shaping the future of the internet.

When not coding, you might find me experimenting with modular synthesis, contributing to open-source projects, or writing about the philosophy of software design. Based in Tel Aviv, working globally, and always open to interesting collaborations.
