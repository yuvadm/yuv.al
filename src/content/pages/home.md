My technical interests span the entire stack: distributed systems and protocols, wireless mesh networks, software defined radio and embedded development on microcontrollers. If I am not working on technology that has political significance or that is a vehicle for social change, something is wrong.

I run [Magic Monad](https://magicmonad.com). I publish code on [Github](https://github.com/yuvadm), and you can also find me on Stack Overflow. Various ramblings in prose are on my [Blog](/blog). All the music I've been listening to since 2004 is on [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/yuval). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yuvadm), but [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@yuvadm) is so much better.

I am also a licensed amateur radio operator, my callsign is [4X5UV](https://www.qrz.com/db/4X5UV).

Some current projects I'm involved with, or otherwise just <3 - [Tel Aviv Makers Hackerspace](https://www.telavivmakers.org), [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), [CryptoParty](https://www.cryptoparty.org), [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com), [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org), [Rust TLV](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-TLV/), [Domain Name Hack Club](https://namehack.club/).
