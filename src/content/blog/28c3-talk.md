So remember my previous post about how it's possible to [data mine the Israeli census database](/blog/data-mining-the-israeli-population-census/)?

My proposal to give a talk about that at the upcoming 28th Chaos Communication
Congress (28C3) has been officially accepted, [and is now published in the Fahrplan](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4652.en.html).

Make sure you drop by if you plan on attending!
