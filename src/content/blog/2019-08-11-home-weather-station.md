title: Monitoring the Weather at Home
---

With the "IoT" market being flooded with products, setting up a weather monitoring station at home is pretty easy, and can be done for a variety of uses. Of course setting up an outdoors weather station is the obvious idea, but my main use case for this projects was to monitor indoors as I was suspecting my AC of having a faulty PID controller. Essentially, I wanted to see how stable my AC really is.

## Weather Board

The main piece of sensing hardware for this station is the [Odroid Weather Board](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/weather-board-2/). It is not only specifically made to work with Odroid devices, which I absolutely love and recommend, but it also has a pair of high quality sensors. The BME280 sensor provides measurements for temperature, barometric pressure and humidity, while the Si1132 sensor provides UV index, ambient light and IR measurements.

## Main Board

The board is connected to a trusty [Odroid C1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c1/) I had that wasn't doing much. Connection is through a simple I2C interface. A sanity test for the board looks like this:

```
$ sudo i2cdetect -y -r 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: 60 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- 76 --
```

This output shows that both addresses `0x60` and `0x76` are active, representing the two sensors.

## Dash Board

The final part is hooking the sensors up to show Prettyâ„¢ visualizations, and for that [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an obvious choice. But to get the data shipped over to the dashboard we need two more parts, a script for polling the sensor for actual data, and a place to store it. Again, another obvious choice is to use [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) as the main time-series database, which works natively with Grafana.

Essentially, since the C1 is a powerful device, we can run the entire setup all on the same board - sensor, database and dashboard.

Once Grafana and Influx are both installed with their services enabled, it's time to create the Influx database

```
$ influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.5.1
InfluxDB shell version: 1.5.1
> create database weatherdb
```

Hooking up to this database from Grafana is also straightforward.

Finally, we need a small Python script that hooks everything up together, here is the basic setup I'm using:

```
import SI1132
import BME280
import time
import pytz

from datetime import datetime
from influxdb import InfluxDBClient

client = InfluxDBClient(host='127.0.0.1', port=8086, database='weatherdb')

I2C = '/dev/i2c-1'
TZ = pytz.timezone('UTC')

si1132 = SI1132.SI1132(I2C)
bme280 = BME280.BME280(I2C, 0x03, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02)


while True:
    data = {
        'uv_index': si1132.readUV() / 100.0,
        'visibile': si1132.readVisible(),
        'ir': si1132.readIR(),
        'temperature': bme280.read_temperature(),
        'humidity': bme280.read_humidity(),
        'pressure': bme280.read_pressure() / 100.0
    }
    body = [{
        'measurement': 'weather',
        'tags': { 'station': 'room1' },
        'time': tz.localize(datetime.now()).isoformat(),
        'fields': data
    }]

    print(body)
    print('---------')
    client.write_points(body)
    time.sleep(10)
```

There are two required libraries here, one for each sensor, and in any case the full code can be found on Github at [https://github.com/yuvadm/weather-station](https://github.com/yuvadm/weather-station)

Now we can open a tmux session, run the script, and then start seeing some data flowing into Grafana! (Can you see the air conditioning PID cycles?)

# Conclusion

The next step for this setup is to add more sensors around my house, possibly outdoors, that send the same data but tag it from another station, so that I can compare between what's going on inside my apartment to how much things are bad outside.

This is your friendly reminder that the earth is *literally* melting, and we are in the middle of the [Sixth Extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction). Maybe it's time a write a blog post about that...
