title: Two-Week Facebook Hiatus
---

I've had it.

My Facebook news feed had become a collection of random shit I could not care
less about. The 5% of news that I am interested in is not worth the constant
infusing of worthless garbage into my brain. Stuff that **is** important to me
will find its way to me in real life.

As of tomorrow, I will be deactivating my Facebook account for a period of two
weeks. The Facebook icon on my bookmark bar will be deleted, as will be all
Facebook history items in my browser.

After two weeks, I'll re-evaluate what all of this means.
